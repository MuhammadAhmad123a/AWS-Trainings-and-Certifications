 Interview Questions for DevOps
 
 Dockerfile ==> a layer of files which you put a base layer and then you add functionality on it. Whent docker runs, it runs at the top
 Cloudformation role on automating the deployments ==> automated tool designed by AWS, it's PaaS, just give the code and run the deployments
 Monitoring tool ==> 
    Prometeus  is used to make the logs and matrics, 
	Granafana is used to make it as dashboard, all the logs are in dashboard, we can also make the analytics over there 
 
 Matrics v Traces:
    Matrics ==> just a scale to measure the numbers
	Traces ==> used for investingation, where it happend and when it happend e.g. in cloud watch
	
 Components of trace:
 
 
 Types of matrics
 
 Terraform
   ==> blue print to autmate the deployments
   State in terraform: the state what we defined and what't the current state
 
 What happend when you change configuration management manually instead of terraform?
 ==> if there is a change in configuration either a terraform file can go currpot or if it distracts automatically it may want to achieve the same configuration 
    that you achieve the same configuration that you configured in terraform
	
	CloudWatch is a native AWS monitoring service, while Prometheus is an open-source monitoring system, and Grafana is an open-source data visualization tool
	
	
 CloudFront
 ==> CDN network, we used it to publish the website, it's best functionality is to caching the resources all over the world
 ==> for global CDN with low latency
 
 Security aspects consiederd while building the application?
 ==> WAF 
 ==> for DDoS attack protection: AWS shield or AWS shield advanced 
 ==> for traffic control: ALB, NLB, GLB, ASG etc.
 
 ==> if we want to block some countries to access from website, use Route53 or CDN
 
 Importance of 
    Security Groups: gives you autherization, no every one can access every resource only authorized groups can access
	Subnets: to mask the ip address or to give you more ip addresses under a network
	
 Cost optimization strategies:
    ==> reduce no of calls by caching the data in dynamoDB or CDN 
	==> Adopt a consumption mode (483)
	==> Measure overall efficiency
	==> Stop spending money on data center operations
	==> Analyze and attribute expenditure
	==> Use managed and application level services to reduce cost of ownership
	
	
 What is serverless?
   ==>Serverless is a new paradigm in which the developers don’t have to manage servers anymore…
    • They just deploy code
    • They just deploy… functions !
    • Initially... Serverless == FaaS (Function as a Service)
    • Serverless was pioneered by AWS Lambda but now also includes anything that’s managed: “databases, messaging, storage, etc.”
    • Serverless does not mean there are no servers… it means you just don’t manage / provision / see them
    • e.g Lambda, 
	
	
 SLI, SLO, SLA
   ==> SLI:
   ==> SLO: 
   ==> SLA: serice level agreement whenverver request is coming in there might be a certain time period we have to check it, troubleshoot it and resolve it
   
 VPN
  ==> virtual private network
  ==> If a company wants to give only access to their employees and want to deny the public access then it will be done through VPN
 
 How to establish inter-connectivity between multiple VPNs?
  ==> Using gateway: using star or any other technology 
  
 how to establish connection between on premises and cloud VPNs?
 ==> using transit gateway
